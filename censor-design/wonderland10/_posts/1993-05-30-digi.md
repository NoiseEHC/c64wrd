8 bit pulse width digi.

There is also a colorcycling scroller. Mayber this was before Amgine, as the exact date of that entry is unknown.

This same colorcycling scroller is used in another part later, but this time in color:

The same digi was used later in a part with a black screen but this time storing all 12 bits of samples. Screenshot is not provided, obviously...
