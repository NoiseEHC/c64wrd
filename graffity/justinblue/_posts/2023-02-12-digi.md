8 bit digi with triangle wave form and reset bit.

<!--more-->

The part plays samples at 7800 Hz (2 raster lines) on all 3 SID channels. It uses a non-raster-fixed irq routine. It writes $11 to the SID channel's wave which outputs a value between 0..240, then $09 to hold the current value, then updates the frequency with the next sample and starts the wave generator with $01. (And the triangle waveform can only reach up to 240 in 126 cycles at maximum frequency.)

The raster bug on the lower right cannot be fixed because there is no raster time for that according to Grabowsky.
