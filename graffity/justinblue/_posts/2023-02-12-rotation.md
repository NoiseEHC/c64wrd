Multicolor animation with sprite overlays.

<!--more-->

The antialiased multicolor disk drive has 5 colors, so the d800 is animated as well as the vram. The 5 colored lines are hires sprites multiplexed, as a single line needs two sprites. The sprite lines are compressed and drawn during animation. The animation has 36 phases, and to fit into memory the csets and vram is mirrored after 18 phases (not 9 phases as multicolor pixels are not 90 degrees symmetric.) The rotation speed is actually slower than the calculation speed because it looks better.
